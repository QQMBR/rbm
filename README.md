Restricted Boltzmann Machine
============================

Simple single layer implementation in haskell.  Take a look at [RBM/List.hs](RBM/List.hs).  

Working on a multi layer implementation using haskells parallel cpu array library.  Take a look at [RBM/Repa.hs](RBM/Repa.hs). The matrix/vector operations are unrolled so its easy to play around with repa's parallelization.
